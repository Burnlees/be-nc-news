# Northcoders News API

- In order to use the API locally, you will have to create two files - `.env.development` & `.env.test` these will be used to set environment variables for PGDATABASE allowing you to conenct to the appropriate database.
    - Inside `.env.test` you will need `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`
    - inside `.env.development` you will need `PGDATABASE=nc_news`
